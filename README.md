A Wall Brew [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) plugin for automating CHANGELOG management for projects using [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/ "The core specification of Semantic Versioning")

## Rationale

The [Wall Brew Open Source Standard](https://github.com/Wall-Brew-Co/open-source#software-documentation) requires libraries to publish change documentation in a human-readable format.
CHANGELOG files tend to be well-structured with embedded convenience links; however, they are almost always manually generated.
Sealog is a tool intended help automate:

* Maintaining and generating links for versions/sections
* Grouping changes by their type [(e.g. "Added", "Fixed", etc.)](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ "The Keep A Changelog homepage, which outlines the categories used by this application")
* Printing the [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) number and release date

## Installation

Sealog is available as a leiningen plugin and can be downloaded from [clojars](https://clojars.org/com.wallbrew/lein-sealog).
To install Sealog, add the following in your `:plugins` list in your `project.clj` file:

```clj
[com.wallbrew/lein-sealog "1.0.0"]
```

The first time you invoke this plugin, Leiningen will automatically fetch the dependency for you.

## Usage

From the root of your project directory, you may invoke the following commands: `init`, `bump`, `render`, and `help`.

### Initialize Sealog

Sealog stores [changelog entries](#change-format) in the `.sealog/changes` directory in your project.
Since new projects will not have this directory by default, Sealog may create it for you.
Additionally, Sealog will create an initial EDN change file for you.

```sh
$ lein sealog init
$ ls .sealog/changes
total 7
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 348 Oct 23 10:42 1-0-0.edn
```

If the `.sealog` directory already exists, Sealog will perform no actions.

```sh
$ lein sealog init
Sealog is already initialized!
```

### Bump Version

Bump creates a new [changelog entry](#change-format) in the `.sealog/changes` directory in your project.
Based on the type of version bump, Sealog will automatically apply the correct SemVer numbering changes.
Valid bump types are: `major`, `minor`, and `patch`.

Assuming the project is currently at version `1.0.0`, `major` will create `2.0.0`

```sh
$ lein sealog bump major
Created new changelog entry: .sealog/2-0-0.edn
```

Assuming the project is currently at version `1.0.0`, `minor` will create `1.1.0`

```sh
$ lein sealog bump minor
Created new changelog entry: .sealog/1-1-0.edn
```

Assuming the project is currently at version `1.0.0`, `patch` will create `1.0.1`

```sh
$ lein sealog bump patch
Created new changelog entry: .sealog/1-0-1.edn
```

If no type is provided, Sealog will automatically apply a `patch` change.
Assuming the project is currently at version `1.0.0`:

```sh
$ lein sealog bump
Created new changelog entry: .sealog/1-0-1.edn
```

### Render Changelog

Finally, Sealog can aggregate and render your change entries into a clean, Markdown format.
By default, Sealog will render this file as `CHANGELOG.md` in the project's root.

```sh
$ lein sealog render
Wrote changelog to: CHANGELOG.md
```

Additionally, you may pass a filename for Sealog to write to instead of CHANGELOG.md

```sh
$ lein sealog render CHANGES.md
Wrote changelog to: CHANGES.md
```

## Change Format

Sealog stores changelog entries within a repository's `.sealog/changes` directory.
A changelog entry is an EDN file storing a map with the following keys:

* `:version` - A map containing a structured representation of a semantic version
* `:version-type` - A keyword denoting the type of versioning system used. For example, `:semver3`
* `:changed` - A map of [**Keep a Changelog**](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) keys, to a sequence of strings containing the changes of that type.
* `:timestamp` - A string containing an [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) timestamp.

Included is an example file for version "1.2.0" of a library.
This file would be located at `.sealog/changes/1-2-0.edn`:

```clj
{:version      {:major 1
                :minor 2
                :patch 0}
 :version-type :semver3
 :changes      {:added      ["A new function `foo` for baz-ing"
                             "Automation to deploy the project to Clojars"]
                :changed    []
                :deprecated ["`quux` was based on an old API no longer supported by source. Consumers should migrate to `foo`"]
                :removed    []
                :fixed      []
                :security   []}, 
 :timestamp    "2022-10-08T22:45:40.974189700Z"}
```
